### **Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis**  
Employee Database Challenge

## Overview
Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. You will submit the following:

  **Deliverable 1:** The Number of Retiring Employees by Title <br>
  
  **Deliverable 2:** The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program<br>
  
  **Deliverable 3:** A written report on the employee database analysis (README.md)<br>

## Summary

   - 90,398 roles are in urgent need to be filled 

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
    - Unfortunately no. There are only 1,940 employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program, not enough to cover mentorship needs.
